# pbmc_scRNAseq_analysis
This repository contains a training analysis of a PBMC dataset with 2700 single cells, sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform, using the Seurat PBMC3k tutorial (https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial). The analysis includes pre-processing, quality control, clustering, and visualisation, ideal for scRNA-seq training.
